The y-intercept of the equation of the trend line (b) can also be found using the numpy.polyfit() function in python. 
The second element of the returned coefficients represents the y-intercept (b) of the trend line. 
Here is an example of how to find the y-intercept of a trend line in python:
'''

import numpy as np

# x and y are the data points
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Fit a linear trend line (degree = 1) to the data points
coefficients = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)

# The y-intercept of the trend line is the second element of the coefficients
y_intercept = coefficients[1]

print("The y-intercept of the trend line is:", y_intercept)
