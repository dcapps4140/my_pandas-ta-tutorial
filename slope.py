The slope of the trend line, also known as the line of best fit, can be found using the numpy library. 
The numpy.polyfit() function can be used to fit a polynomial of a certain degree to a set of data points. 
The first element of the returned coefficients represents the slope (m) of the trend line. 
Here is an example of how to find the slope of a trend line in python:
'''

import numpy as np

# x and y are the data points
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Fit a linear trend line (degree = 1) to the data points
coefficients = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)

# The slope of the trend line is the first element of the coefficients
slope = coefficients[0]

print("The slope of the trend line is:", slope)
